== Optimality Conditions ==
We know that if stem:[\mathbf{x}_0] is an optimal solution, then the necessary condition is that

[stem]
++++
\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0)^\top (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_0) \geq 0 \hspace{1cm} \forall \mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_0) \cap \mathcal{F}
++++

As a special case, when stem:[\mathcal{F}] is an open set or when there is no any restriction, the above condition can be equivalently written as

[stem]
++++
\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0) = \mathbf{0}
++++

But if stem:[\mathcal{F}] is a complicated set, only stem:[\mathbf{x}_0]'s that satisfy the first condition will be our potential optimal points. Typically it is difficult to evaluate the first condition. This condition can be broken down and can be written in a convenient way. Those equivalent conditions are known as KKT conditions.

NOTE: The KKT conditions are necessary, they are not sufficient for optimality.
