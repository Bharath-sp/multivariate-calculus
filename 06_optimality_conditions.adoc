== Characterizing Optimality ==
We are usually interested in the certificate of optimality. We need some mathematical conditions which can certify that the solution is optimal. There are some certificates for optimality.

When stem:[\mathbf{x}^*] is an optimal solution, it means

. stem:[\mathbf{x}^* \in \mathcal{F}], i.e., it should be in the feasible set.
. stem:[f(\mathbf{x}^*) =] value of the MP.

Say our MP is stem:[\min_{\mathbf{x} \in D} f(\mathbf{x})]. Then it is equivalent to say

[stem]
++++
f(\mathbf{x}^*) = \min_{\mathbf{x} \in D} f(\mathbf{x}) \iff f(\mathbf{x}^*) \leq f(\mathbf{x}) \hspace{1cm} \forall \mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{F}
++++

Here the LHS has only one equality and the RHS has uncountable number of inequalities (assuming we have our uncountable number of elements in our feasible set).

If stem:[\mathbf{x}_0] has to be optimal, what are the necessary conditions and sufficient conditions?

If stem:[\mathbf{x}_0] has to be optimum, at least in the neighborhood of stem:[\mathbf{x}_0], the function values should be greater than the function value at stem:[\mathbf{x}_0]. The linear approximation of the function at stem:[\mathbf{x}_0] is

[stem]
++++
l_{\mathbf{x}_0}(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{x}_0) + \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0)^\top (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_0)
++++

We are at stem:[\mathbf{x}_0], if we move instantaneously in any direction from stem:[\mathbf{x}_0] which is given by the vector stem:[(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_0)], we are saying that the function value should be greater than or equal to stem:[f(\mathbf{x}_0)]. That is

[stem]
++++
\begin{align*}
f(\mathbf{x}_0) + \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0)^\top (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_0) & \geq f(\mathbf{x}_0) \\
\iff \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0)^\top (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_0) & \geq 0 && \forall \mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_0) \cap \mathcal{F} \\
\iff \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0) = \mathbf{0}
\end{align*}
++++

====
* If the gradient of stem:[f] at a point stem:[\mathbf{x}_0] is stem:[\mathbf{0}], then it means that in the neighborhood of stem:[\mathbf{x}_0]

** The function values are all greater than or equal to stem:[f(\mathbf{x}_0)] (or) 
** The function values are all lesser than or equal to stem:[f(\mathbf{x}_0)] (or)
** In some directions the function values are all greater than or equal and in some other directions the function values are all less than or equal (saddle point).

So if the gradient of stem:[f] at a point stem:[\mathbf{x}_0] is stem:[\mathbf{0}], we cannot say much. Such points where the gradient is stem:[\mathbf{0}] are called as *stationary points*.

* But if we want all the function values to be greater than or equal to stem:[f(\mathbf{x}_0)] in the neighborhood of stem:[\mathbf{x}_0], then definitely the gradient of stem:[f] at that point stem:[\mathbf{x}_0] should be stem:[\mathbf{0}].

If stem:[\mathbf{x}_0] has to be local minima, the gradient of stem:[f] at stem:[\mathbf{x}_0] should be stem:[\mathbf{0}]. This is the necessary condition, but not the sufficient condition.
====

* Whenever there is no restriction in the direction that we can go from stem:[\mathbf{x}_0] or when the feasibility set is an open set (doesn't include the boundary points), then the gradient of stem:[f] should be stem:[\mathbf{0}] at such point for the point to be a local minima.

* But if there is restriction in the direction that we can go from stem:[\mathbf{x}_0] because of the feasibility set, then the gradient being stem:[\mathbf{0}] is not a valid condition. Then at that point we need to verify stem:[\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_0)^\top (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_0) \geq 0] for it to be a local minima.
