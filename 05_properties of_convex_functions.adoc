== Properties of Convex Functions ==
* Convex functions are continuous in the interior of the domain of the definition of the function. If there is any discontinuity of a convex function, it must be occurring at the boundary of the domain of the definition of the function.

* Any convex function is locally Lipschitz continuous.
* Any convex function which is not given to be differentiable, still has directional derivative at any interior point of the domain of the definition of the function.
